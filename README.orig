Customization:

Certain things can be customized by the definition of some vim variables in
your ~/.vimrc file.

Variables:
> g:fuzzywordcompletion_disable_keybinding:
  - Default:0
  - Details: This variable can be to used to tell the plugin that the '<Ctrl-k>' 
    binding should not be mapped.
    Example:
        let g:fuzzywordcompletion_disable_keybinding=1

> g:fuzzywordcompletion_maxresults: 
  - Default: 10
  - Details: This variable has the control over the result list lenght.
    Yo can define this variable in the ~/.vimrc to change it.
    Example:
        let g:fuzzywordcompletion_maxresults=20

>g:fuzzywordcompletion_completiontable: 
  - Default: Preserves alfanumeric chars + '_'.
  - Details: This variable contains an array of 256 bytes that represents the 
    translation table that will be used to split words. Each position should be 
    completed with the char that will replace the pointed position. 
    For example, if you want that words will be splitted with the '0' char, you 
    must put a ' ' in the position 48 of the table ('0'=48 ascii).
